So this is it, my first post on my nifty new blog. I have been meaning to do this for while but I just never got around to starting. Well that's not true, like so many other things I never got around to seeing it through to completion. Having some knowledge of technology makes it easy to start a lot of things. When you know a nice modern framework like Ruby on Rails or my new favorite: [Backbonejs](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) it is easy to come up with an idea or look at a crumby site and think: I could crank that out in a weekend, and it would be soooo awesome. And I try: I register a new domain name, I `rails new my_great_idea`, but then stuff happens, I hit a snag, it starts to feel like work and eventually it gets replaced by a new `rails new great_idea`.

But this is going to be different. I am going to stick this one out. One blog post a week minimum. From now on. For real...

{% pullquote %}
I will now proceed to play with all the new features of my wicked-cool blogging framework. It is called a blogging framework for hackers but I think they should call it a blogging framework {" for dummies who know a bit about rake "}. Ha ha, you see what I did there? You have to admit that is pretty `nifty`.
. Ok so the results were not exactly what I was going for, but I think I just need to extend this paragraph a little bit... so there is at least one more line wrapping the pull quote and there, that's better.
{% endpullquote %}

Ok now stand back, I am going to write a little ruby:

```ruby Test Code
def foo x
  puts "This is #{x}!"
end

foo "Awesome"
```

Wow that was so easy and it looks great. This is Awesome!
