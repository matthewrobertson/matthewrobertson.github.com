    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>I have created <a href="https://github.com/matthewrobertson/ress">a gem</a> that provides a strategy for building mobile optimized Rails applications by combining the strengths of client-side feature detection with the flexibility of server-side component optimization, and respects Google’s best practices for SEO and web-caching.<!-- more --></p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>As the diversity of internet-connected devices increases, the challenge of building great web applications that work well on all platforms is becoming more important - and more difficult. Currently, there is a shortage of great ideas in the Rails community about how best to tackle this problem.  Most developers lean heavily on one of two approaches: creating a responsive design using CSS media queries, or serving a custom UI based on user agent string detection. However, mobile optimization is a complex problem that involves configuring many aspects of a site, so it is best not to limit yourself to a purely client side or server side approach.</p>

<h3>Responsive Design</h3>

<p>Responsive design is quickly becoming dogma for the best way to build mobile-friendly websites. While CSS media queries are great for tweaking the layout of HTML on different devices, when used alone, they fall short of being the one and only tool needed to provide a truly optimized mobile user experience. This is because there is much more to consider than just screen size. Less powerful CPUs, slower network connections and touch-oriented interfaces all impact the performance and user experience of your site on mobile devices. When all these limitations are taken into consideration, it is obvious that adding more CSS for the user to download and interpret is not a silver bullet.</p>

<h3>Detecting user-agent strings on the server</h3>

<p>While less popular, server-side solutions tend to be more flexible and capable of addressing device limitations. The approach of pushing an alternate UI, based on the user agent string, has been demonstrated in a <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/199-mobile-devices">Railscast episode</a> and implemented in the <a href="https://github.com/brendanlim/mobile-fu">Mobile Fu gem</a>. Unfortunately, both of these solutions suffer from some serious flaws.</p>

<p>First, serving different versions of a web page at the same URL is not RESTful and can have unwanted consequences (eg caching and SEO). Furthermore, user agent detection can be inaccurate and requires constant maintenance as new devices and software come to market. From an implementation perspective, the practice of aliasing a mime type and explicitly setting <code>request.format</code> makes it <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/3855">difficult to share templates</a> between the mobile and canonical versions of a site.</p>

<h2>A Better Solution</h2>

<p>Responsive design and server-side approaches each have their own pros and cons. Luke Wroblewski wrote a <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1392">nice article</a> in which he describes a system that combines the strengths of responsive web design with server side component optimization. It inspired me to implement a similar system for the Rails framework and package it up as a <a href="https://github.com/matthewrobertson/ress">gem called RESS</a>. Currently, we are using RESS in the app we are building at <a href="https://www.medeo.ca/">Medeo</a> and have been pleased with the results.</p>

<p>RESS provides three major features that you can use to optimize your application for different platforms:</p>

<h3>1. Annotating mobile versions of your app:</h3>

<p>RESS allows you to specify alternate versions of your rails app. You can add as many alternate versions as you need (eg one for tablets, one for phones etc). Each alternate version has two mandatory attributes: 1) A subdomain under which the version will be served and 2) a media query that describes the type of clients that should be redirected to that version.</p>

<p>Once registered, RESS provides a helper method called <code>ress_anotation_tags</code> that can be used to add annotations to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of your document. These tags describe where the alternate versions of your site are located and which devices should be redirected to them.</p>

<p>For example, an alternate version of a mobile site might include a tag like this:</p>

<p><code>html
&lt;link rel="alternate" media="only screen and (max-width: 640px)" href="http://m.example.com/page-1" &gt;
</code></p>

<p>The mobile version of the page would also have a link pointing back the canonical version of the app, eg:</p>

<p><code>html
&lt;link rel="canonical" href="http://www.example.com/page-1" &gt;
</code>
These annotations conform to SEO best practices for mobile optimized websites <a href="https://developers.google.com/webmasters/smartphone-sites/details">as documented by Google</a>.</p>

<h3>2. Client-side feature detection and redirects:</h3>

<p>As an alternative to redirecting users based on user agent string matching, RESS provides a mechanism to redirect users based on client-side feature detection. When a request comes into your site, the javascript included with RESS will parse all of the <code>[rel="alternate"]</code> links in your markup and evaluate their associated media queries to determine if there is an alternate version that matches the client. If there is, the user is redirected to the url for that version of your application.</p>

<p>The idea for this style of client-side redirection (and much of the implementation) was adapted from the <a href="https://github.com/borismus/device.js">devicejs library</a> by Boris Smus.</p>

<h3>3. Server-side component optimization:</h3>

<p>When a request comes in to your application via one of the alternate version's subdomains, RESS prepends a path to the list of view paths available for the controller handling that request. Each alternate version has its own views folder that can be configured to exist anywhere in your application's file structure. Any templates, partials or layouts available in the prepended view path take precedence over those in <code>app/views</code>. This allows you to overload individual templates for any version of your site.</p>

<p>For example, if you wanted to customize the signup form for the <code>mobile</code> version of your app, you would simply need to create a new partial called <code>app/mobile_views/users/new.html.erb</code> with custom markup. If you do not provide a mobile template, Rails will fall back to <code>app/views</code>, as normal.</p>

<p>For smaller tweaks, RESS creates view helpers and controller methods for detecting which alternate version of the app has been requested. eg:</p>

<p><code>erb
&lt;% if mobile_request? %&gt;
  &lt;%= image_tag 'low-res.png' %&gt;
&lt;% else %&gt;
  &lt;%= image_tag 'high-res.png' %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></p>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

<p>RESS may not be a great for a fit for all applications but I have done my best to implement the features in an a la carte manner so that you can pick and chose which are best for you. For example, if you don’t want to suffer the performance costs of client-side redirects, you can leave the <code>ress.js</code> file out of your application and do your own server-side user agent redirects. But keep the <code>ress_annotation_tags</code> to stay consistent with Google’s SEO best practices.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lately, I have been spending a lot of time working on an open source EPUB3 viewer called <a href="https://github.com/readium/readium">Readium</a>. The project is built entirely with HTML5 / javascript and distributed as a chrome extension. A while ago while testing in <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/chromesxs/">Chrome Canary</a> I noticed a warning that support for manifest version 1 is being phased out in favour of version 2.<!-- more --> At first glance, this upgrade required only a couple very minor modifications to my <code>manifest.json</code> (a list of all changes in v2 is available <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/manifestVersion.html">here</a>). But, these things are never easy, and sure enough when I tried to use the extension with the updated <code>manifest.json</code> everything was busted. I opened the developer console and found the following error message:</p>

<p><code>Uncaught Error: Code generation from strings disallowed for this context</code></p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>It turns out the biggest change in manifest version 2 is the inclusion of a default <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/contentSecurityPolicy.html">content security policy</a>. Two features that have been strictly locked down by this policy are the execution of inline javascipt and the evaluation of strings with the use of both <code>eval()</code> and <code>new Function()</code>. The reason is that these features open a door for a malicious third-party to coerce your application into evaling a string of injected code and thereby abuse the elevated permissions you enjoy as an extension. This is a GOOD thing. Security should always be a top priority and as extensions are granted more and more permissions the potential harm from these types of exploits is increasing. Besides, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford">Crockford</a> listed evaling strings as one of the <a href="http://oreilly.com/javascript/excerpts/javascript-good-parts/bad-parts.html#eval">bad parts</a> so you probably shouldn't be doing it anyway. That said, if you are using a Javascript templating library, it is likely you are going to run into problems.</p>

<p>Javascript templates basically work by taking some text content and doing some lexical parsing to split the code and html tokens. Those tokens are then used to compile a function that returns an HTML string. John Resig wrote a nice <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-micro-templating/">blog post</a> that goes into a more depth. The problem with Resig's approach (which is very similar to how many client side templating libraries work) is that it uses <code>new Funtion()</code> to create a function from a string, an action that is now banned by Chrome's content security policy.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>In a recent <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9KOS1VQgqQ&amp;html5=1">I/O talk</a> the chrome extensions team suggested that one way to use javascript templates in compliance with the new CSP is to create a sandboxed page (in which <code>eval()</code> and <code>new Function</code> are allowed), load it in an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> and then pass messages back and forth to render templates. They have even created a basic <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-app-samples/tree/master/eval-in-iframe">sample</a> that demonstrates how to do this.</p>

<p>But, if the idea of passing messages to a sandboxed iframe has your eyes glazing over, <strong>DON'T PANIC</strong> there is an easier way: precompile your templates before you deploy your extension. If you peform the <code>template =&gt; function</code> conversion as part of your build process, you remove the need to evade the content security policy at run time. Two libraries I am aware of that offer precompilation as a feature are <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">handlebarsjs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/eco/">ECO</a>. I decided to go with handlebars for my project and found it extremely simple to set up. If you want to do the same here is a step by step guide:</p>

<h3>1. Install handlebarsjs</h3>

<p>Handlebarsjs is distributed as an npm package, so if you don't have nodejs installed get it from <a href="http://nodejs.org/#download">here</a>. Once you have node you can install handlebarsjs using npm:</p>

<p><code>$ npm install handlebars -g</code></p>

<p>(the <code>-g</code> option gives you global installation so you can use handlebars for any project on your system)</p>

<h3>2. Put each template into a file of its own.</h3>

<p>If you have a setup like mine, your templates are all in <code>&lt;script type="text/template"&gt;</code> tags in your html files. In order to get precompilation working you need to put each template into its own (uniquely named) file. Each file should have a <code>.handlebars</code> extension.</p>

<h3>3. Convert your templates to handlebarsjs tempates</h3>

<p>If you weren't already using handlebarsjs, you will need to convert your templates to use the handlebarjs format. This will require varying amounts of effort depending on the template library you were using previously. I was using <a href="http://underscorejs.org/#template">Underscore's microtemplates</a>, but I kept the logic in my templates very thin. A global find and replace that swapped <code>&lt;%=</code> and <code>%&gt;</code> for <code>{ {</code> and <code>}}</code> took care of 90% of the conversion. A good overview of how handlebarsjs works is available on <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">their site</a>.</p>

<h3>4. Compile your templates</h3>

<p>You can compile all of your <code>.handlebars</code> templates into a single <code>.js</code> file in one shot like this:</p>

<p><code>$ handlebars path/to/templates/*.handlebars -f path/to/scripts/templates.js</code></p>

<p>A more in depth description of precompilation is available <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/precompilation.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>5. Include some scripts</h3>

<p>Before you can start using your templates, you need to include them in your code. Add a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag to your html that includes the <code>templates.js</code> file we just generated. You also need to include the handlebars runtime, which you can download from <a href="https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/archives/master">github</a>.</p>

<h3>6. Use 'em</h3>

<p>Handlebars makes all of your templates accesable via the global <code>Handlbars.templates</code> object. Each template is named according to its file name, so if your input file is <code>person.handlebars,</code> it will be available as <code>Handlebars.templates.person</code>.</p>

<h3>Bonus</h3>

<p>If you like to over-optimize your development environment like I do, you can use this <a href="https://github.com/aiwilliams/guard-handlebars">Guard configuration</a> to watch your <code>.handlebars</code> files and re-compile them automatically whenever you make changes.</p>

<h2>Added Perks</h2>

<p>My main motivation for doing this was to move my extension off the deprecated Manifest version 1 configuration, but there are other benefits as well. Having each template in its own file is much tidier, and thus, more maintainable. And, because your clients no longer have to perform the compilation step when loading the page, you get a performance bonus too!</p>
