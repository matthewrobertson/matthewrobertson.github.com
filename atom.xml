    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post I am going to go over how you can roll your own JSON serialization solution to use in a Rails app in less than 40 lines of code. The idea makes use of basic object oriented techniques (inheritance and hook methods) to leverage the serialization functionality provided by Rails out of the box.<!-- more --> If you are not interested in the step by step explanation, you can skip to <a href="https://gist.github.com/matthewrobertson/6129035">this gist</a> I created with the fully fleshed out base class and a sample serializer subclass.</p>

<h2>The Why</h2>

<p>The Medeo app passes data between the backend Rails code and client side Javascript as JSON objects in three ways: via AJAX requests, through websockets and in rendered html pages via <code>data</code> attributes. This often means reusing serialization code in different parts of the app in different contexts. For this reason none of the popular template based JSON DSLs (eg <a href="https://github.com/nesquena/rabl">RABL</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rails/jbuilder">jBuilder</a>) really fit our use case. The <a href="https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers"><code>ActiveModel::Serializers</code> gem</a> was much closer to what we wanted but I was put off by its complexity. Eventually we ended up rolling our own simple, elegant solution that is serving us nicely.</p>

<h2>An Example</h2>

<p>To explain how we came up with this solution and how it works lets start with a simple example: a blog application that allows commenting. Comments are written by users so the app may have some <code>ActiveRecord</code> models that look something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Comment</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">html_body</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="s2">&quot;&lt;p&gt;</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">body</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&lt;/p&gt;&quot;</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">User</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">attr_accessible</span> <span class="ss">:name</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">has_many</span> <span class="ss">:comments</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>The Basic Idea</h2>

<p>In order to create comments using AJAX and render our UI on the client side we need to return a JSON response that is composed of the comment&#8217;s attributes as well as its user&#8217;s attributes. This can be done easily using the <code>as_json</code> method provided by Rails&#8217; <code>Serialization</code> module. If you take a look at the <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveModel/Serializers/JSON.html">documenation</a>, you will see that it accepts an optional hash that can be used to shape the format of the returned JSON. The specific options that we care about are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>:only</code> to limit the attributes included in the json</li>
<li><code>:methods</code> to include the result of some method calls on the model</li>
<li><code>:include</code> to include associations</li>
</ul>


<p>Using these options, we can get the JSON we want as follows:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is the result we wanted but it is still not quite and ideal solution. The <code>as_json</code> method call is definitely a bit hairy.If we wanted to reuse this serialization code would have copy all of the arguments we passed to <code>as_json</code> around the code base. This would be a nightmare if we ever needed to change things. The natural way to clean this up is to create a class to encapsulate the responsibility of the serializing comments:</p>

<p>Now we can serialize comments by creating an instance of our serializer class: <code>CommentSerializer.new(@comment).as_json</code>. This has the added benefit of enabling us to easily test our serialization code in isolation. I personally think testing this type of serialization code is extremely important as it enforces the interface that connects your rails app to your javascript code.</p>

<h2>A Reusable Pattern</h2>

<p>Eventually we are going to want to serialize some models other than comments and it would be nice to reuse this pattern in these instances. One way to do this is to move the generic serialization bits into an abstract base class:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">BaseSerializer</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">initialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">serialized_object</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="vi">@serialized_object</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">serialized_object</span>

</span><span class='line'>      <span class="n">serialized_object</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">as_json</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:only</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">attributes</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:methods</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="nb">methods</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:includes</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">includes</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">merge</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">options</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kp">private</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">attributes</span> <span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">includes</span>   <span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">end</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now we can create serializers by simply inheriting from the <code>BaseSerializer</code> class and overriding the <code>attribute</code>, <code>includes</code> and <code>methods</code> hook methods. Making use of this base class, our <code>CommentSerializer</code> ends up looking something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h1>More Complex JSON Attributes</h1>

<p>So far our solution is confined only to attributes, methods and associations defined inside of the class we are serializing. Obviously it would be nice if we could lift this constraint in order to create more complex JSON without packing our model full of methods that don&#8217;t belong in it. One requirement that I come up against often is to include resource URLs in JSON responses. To do this we can simply include the Rails URL helpers in our base class, and then use them to augment the return value of a call to <code>super</code> from our derived class:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>If you were paying close attention, you may notice that the above changes actually broke something. Before it provided its own <code>as_json</code> method, our <code>CommentSerializer</code> was capable of serializing both individual comments as well as collections of comments. This is because Rails provides an implementation of <code>as_json</code> for both <code>Array</code>s and <code>ActiveRecord::Relation</code>s that essentially map a collection by calling <code>as_json</code> on each of its members. We can do the same the same thing, by adding a layer of indirection in our <code>as_json</code> method and creating another method that serializes individual instances:</p>

<p>The above code detects if it is serializing an individual model or a collection by testing if the <code>serialized_object</code> responds to <code>to_ary</code> (ie whether or not it can be coerced into an array). If it is a collection, it returns an array generated by serializing every element in the collection.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>That&#8217;s pretty much the entire solution. If you want to take a peak at the fully fleshed out <code>BaseSerializer</code> and <code>CommentSerializer</code> classes check out <a href="https://gist.github.com/matthewrobertson/6129035">this gist</a>. As always, I am interested to hear any opinions / suggestions you might have.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>I have created <a href="https://github.com/matthewrobertson/ress">a gem</a> that provides a strategy for building mobile optimized Rails applications by combining the strengths of client-side feature detection with the flexibility of server-side component optimization, and respects Google’s best practices for SEO and web-caching.<!-- more --></p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>As the diversity of internet-connected devices increases, the challenge of building great web applications that work well on all platforms is becoming more important - and more difficult. Currently, there is a shortage of great ideas in the Rails community about how best to tackle this problem.  Most developers lean heavily on one of two approaches: creating a responsive design using CSS media queries, or serving a custom UI based on user agent string detection. However, mobile optimization is a complex problem that involves configuring many aspects of a site, so it is best not to limit yourself to a purely client side or server side approach.</p>

<h3>Responsive Design</h3>

<p>Responsive design is quickly becoming dogma for the best way to build mobile-friendly websites. While CSS media queries are great for tweaking the layout of HTML on different devices, when used alone, they fall short of being the one and only tool needed to provide a truly optimized mobile user experience. This is because there is much more to consider than just screen size. Less powerful CPUs, slower network connections and touch-oriented interfaces all impact the performance and user experience of your site on mobile devices. When all these limitations are taken into consideration, it is obvious that adding more CSS for the user to download and interpret is not a silver bullet.</p>

<h3>Detecting user-agent strings on the server</h3>

<p>While less popular, server-side solutions tend to be more flexible and capable of addressing device limitations. The approach of pushing an alternate UI, based on the user agent string, has been demonstrated in a <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/199-mobile-devices">Railscast episode</a> and implemented in the <a href="https://github.com/brendanlim/mobile-fu">Mobile Fu gem</a>. Unfortunately, both of these solutions suffer from some serious flaws.</p>

<p>First, serving different versions of a web page at the same URL is not RESTful and can have unwanted consequences (eg caching and SEO). Furthermore, user agent detection can be inaccurate and requires constant maintenance as new devices and software come to market. From an implementation perspective, the practice of aliasing a mime type and explicitly setting <code>request.format</code> makes it <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/3855">difficult to share templates</a> between the mobile and canonical versions of a site.</p>

<h2>A Better Solution</h2>

<p>Responsive design and server-side approaches each have their own pros and cons. Luke Wroblewski wrote a <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1392">nice article</a> in which he describes a system that combines the strengths of responsive web design with server side component optimization. It inspired me to implement a similar system for the Rails framework and package it up as a <a href="https://github.com/matthewrobertson/ress">gem called RESS</a>. Currently, we are using RESS in the app we are building at <a href="https://www.medeo.ca/">Medeo</a> and have been pleased with the results.</p>

<p>RESS provides three major features that you can use to optimize your application for different platforms:</p>

<h3>1. Annotating mobile versions of your app:</h3>

<p>RESS allows you to specify alternate versions of your rails app. You can add as many alternate versions as you need (eg one for tablets, one for phones etc). Each alternate version has two mandatory attributes: 1) A subdomain under which the version will be served and 2) a media query that describes the type of clients that should be redirected to that version.</p>

<p>Once registered, RESS provides a helper method called <code>ress_anotation_tags</code> that can be used to add annotations to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of your document. These tags describe where the alternate versions of your site are located and which devices should be redirected to them.</p>

<p>For example, an alternate version of a mobile site might include a tag like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">&quot;alternate&quot;</span> <span class="na">media=</span><span class="s">&quot;only screen and (max-width: 640px)&quot;</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://m.example.com/page-1&quot;</span> <span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The mobile version of the page would also have a link pointing back the canonical version of the app, eg:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">&quot;canonical&quot;</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://www.example.com/page-1&quot;</span> <span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>These annotations conform to SEO best practices for mobile optimized websites <a href="https://developers.google.com/webmasters/smartphone-sites/details">as documented by Google</a>.</p>

<h3>2. Client-side feature detection and redirects:</h3>

<p>As an alternative to redirecting users based on user agent string matching, RESS provides a mechanism to redirect users based on client-side feature detection. When a request comes into your site, the javascript included with RESS will parse all of the <code>[rel="alternate"]</code> links in your markup and evaluate their associated media queries to determine if there is an alternate version that matches the client. If there is, the user is redirected to the url for that version of your application.</p>

<p>The idea for this style of client-side redirection (and much of the implementation) was adapted from the <a href="https://github.com/borismus/device.js">devicejs library</a> by Boris Smus.</p>

<h3>3. Server-side component optimization:</h3>

<p>When a request comes in to your application via one of the alternate version&#8217;s subdomains, RESS prepends a path to the list of view paths available for the controller handling that request. Each alternate version has its own views folder that can be configured to exist anywhere in your application&#8217;s file structure. Any templates, partials or layouts available in the prepended view path take precedence over those in <code>app/views</code>. This allows you to overload individual templates for any version of your site.</p>

<p>For example, if you wanted to customize the signup form for the <code>mobile</code> version of your app, you would simply need to create a new partial called <code>app/mobile_views/users/new.html.erb</code> with custom markup. If you do not provide a mobile template, Rails will fall back to <code>app/views</code>, as normal.</p>

<p>For smaller tweaks, RESS creates view helpers and controller methods for detecting which alternate version of the app has been requested. eg:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='erb'><span class='line'><span class="cp">&lt;%</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">mobile_request?</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">  </span><span class="cp">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">image_tag</span> <span class="s1">&#39;low-res.png&#39;</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="cp">&lt;%</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">  </span><span class="cp">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">image_tag</span> <span class="s1">&#39;high-res.png&#39;</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="cp">&lt;%</span> <span class="k">end</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Caveats</h2>

<p>RESS may not be a great for a fit for all applications but I have done my best to implement the features in an a la carte manner so that you can pick and chose which are best for you. For example, if you don’t want to suffer the performance costs of client-side redirects, you can leave the <code>ress.js</code> file out of your application and do your own server-side user agent redirects. But keep the <code>ress_annotation_tags</code> to stay consistent with Google’s SEO best practices.</p>

    <id>http://matthewrobertson.org/blog/2012/09/20/decoupling-rails-forms-from-the-database</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One issue that caused me a lot of pain on my first few rails projects was the natural coupling that developed between the database and the rest of my application. The “skinny controller, fat model” mantra has been the prevalent in the Rails community since the early days. The problem with this philosophy is that it is only 50% accurate. If you are building good object oriented software, you shouldn’t have a fat anything.<!-- more --> When all of your business logic is encased in ActiveRecord objects, there can be some unfortunate consequences: things become difficult to reason about, it is hard to test objects in isolation and changing the database schema is a painful process that demands updates to many parts of the application.</p>

<p>In my opinion, one of worst offending features of rails is the ability to build nested model forms with <code>fields_for</code> and <code>accepts_nested_attributes_for</code>, as doing so directly couples your view layer to your database schema. Lately, I have been using a very simple technique to prevent this problem that I call building aggregate models.</p>

<h2>An Example</h2>

<p>Consider as an example, an application in which the <code>User</code> model <code>has_one</code> associated <code>Email</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1"># validations etc...</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Email</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The rails way to handle this association is to build a nested model form via <code>fields_for</code>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='erb'><span class='line'><span class="cp">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">form_for</span> <span class="vi">@user</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">  </span><span class="cp">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">text_field</span> <span class="ss">:name</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">  </span><span class="cp">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fields_for</span> <span class="vi">@user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">email</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="nb">p</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">    </span><span class="cp">&lt;%=</span> <span class="nb">p</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">email_field</span> <span class="ss">:email</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">  </span><span class="cp">&lt;%</span> <span class="k">end</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">  </span><span class="cp">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">password_field</span> <span class="ss">:password</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="cp">&lt;%</span> <span class="k">end</span><span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The obvious problem with this is that it couples the view directly to the database structure. If we decided to make changes to the database schema later, the form will need to be updated. I also find that <code>accepts_nested_attributes_for</code> is awkward to test and the subtleties of the api are difficult to remember and work with (e.g. mass assignment errors, associated validations).</p>

<p>Another option that many rails developers might opt for in this situation is to de-normalize the database and smash the <code>emails</code> and <code>users</code> tables together into one. In this case I decided to keep <code>emails</code> as a separate entity because they are going to have their own attributes (e.g. <code>verified?</code>). I also anticipate a requirement that users will have many emails. While there is <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/07/maybe-normalizing-isnt-normal.html">a case</a> to be made against normalization in some situations, the fact that it makes your view layer simpler to code is part of it.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>Lately, the approach I have been using in these situations has been to create a class to accept the form data and translate it to the active record layer. In Rails 3.0 the API required by controllers and views was extracted into <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2010/01/10/activemodel-make-any-ruby-object-feel-like-activerecord/">a set of modules</a> that can be included as needed. This allows us to create an object that is guaranteed to jive with <code>form_for</code> (or any other form gem you may be using) that is completely decoupled from <code>ActiveRecord</code>. To handle the example above, we might end up with something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>By adding a thin layer of indirection, this pattern reduces the coupling between the view layer and database. There are a few other big wins that come with it as well:</p>

<ul>
<li>the form markup is now as simple as it would be for one model with no associations</li>
<li>we can move business logic out of the <code>ActiveRecord</code> classes and allow them to focus on their persistence responsibility (e.g. hash and salt the password before passing assigning it to <code>User</code>)</li>
<li>we can add a different set of validations at the profile level (e.g. that are only pertinent to new users for example the confirmation of password)</li>
</ul>


<p>Obviously we could enhance the <code>Profile</code> class to make it feel more like an <code>ActiveRecord</code> object (e.g. define <code>update_attributes</code> or a static <code>find_by_user_id</code> method that initializes the model for existing records) but for simple cases there is no need.</p>

<p>As always, this pattern should be used sparingly. Resist the urge to optimize prematurely.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lately, I have been spending a lot of time working on an open source EPUB3 viewer called <a href="https://github.com/readium/readium">Readium</a>. The project is built entirely with HTML5 / javascript and distributed as a chrome extension. A while ago while testing in <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/chromesxs/">Chrome Canary</a> I noticed a warning that support for manifest version 1 is being phased out in favour of version 2.<!-- more --> At first glance, this upgrade required only a couple very minor modifications to my <code>manifest.json</code> (a list of all changes in v2 is available <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/manifestVersion.html">here</a>). But, these things are never easy, and sure enough when I tried to use the extension with the updated <code>manifest.json</code> everything was busted. I opened the developer console and found the following error message:</p>

<p><code>Uncaught Error: Code generation from strings disallowed for this context</code></p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>It turns out the biggest change in manifest version 2 is the inclusion of a default <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/contentSecurityPolicy.html">content security policy</a>. Two features that have been strictly locked down by this policy are the execution of inline javascipt and the evaluation of strings with the use of both <code>eval()</code> and <code>new Function()</code>. The reason is that these features open a door for a malicious third-party to coerce your application into evaling a string of injected code and thereby abuse the elevated permissions you enjoy as an extension. This is a GOOD thing. Security should always be a top priority and as extensions are granted more and more permissions the potential harm from these types of exploits is increasing. Besides, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford">Crockford</a> listed evaling strings as one of the <a href="http://oreilly.com/javascript/excerpts/javascript-good-parts/bad-parts.html#eval">bad parts</a> so you probably shouldn&#8217;t be doing it anyway. That said, if you are using a Javascript templating library, it is likely you are going to run into problems.</p>

<p>Javascript templates basically work by taking some text content and doing some lexical parsing to split the code and html tokens. Those tokens are then used to compile a function that returns an HTML string. John Resig wrote a nice <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-micro-templating/">blog post</a> that goes into a more depth. The problem with Resig&#8217;s approach (which is very similar to how many client side templating libraries work) is that it uses <code>new Funtion()</code> to create a function from a string, an action that is now banned by Chrome&#8217;s content security policy.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>In a recent <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9KOS1VQgqQ&amp;html5=1">I/O talk</a> the chrome extensions team suggested that one way to use javascript templates in compliance with the new CSP is to create a sandboxed page (in which <code>eval()</code> and <code>new Function</code> are allowed), load it in an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> and then pass messages back and forth to render templates. They have even created a basic <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-app-samples/tree/master/eval-in-iframe">sample</a> that demonstrates how to do this.</p>

<p>But, if the idea of passing messages to a sandboxed iframe has your eyes glazing over, <strong>DON&#8217;T PANIC</strong> there is an easier way: precompile your templates before you deploy your extension. If you peform the <code>template =&gt; function</code> conversion as part of your build process, you remove the need to evade the content security policy at run time. Two libraries I am aware of that offer precompilation as a feature are <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">handlebarsjs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/eco/">ECO</a>. I decided to go with handlebars for my project and found it extremely simple to set up. If you want to do the same here is a step by step guide:</p>

<h3>1. Install handlebarsjs</h3>

<p>Handlebarsjs is distributed as an npm package, so if you don&#8217;t have nodejs installed get it from <a href="http://nodejs.org/#download">here</a>. Once you have node you can install handlebarsjs using npm:</p>

<p><code>$ npm install handlebars -g</code></p>

<p>(the <code>-g</code> option gives you global installation so you can use handlebars for any project on your system)</p>

<h3>2. Put each template into a file of its own.</h3>

<p>If you have a setup like mine, your templates are all in <code>&lt;script type="text/template"&gt;</code> tags in your html files. In order to get precompilation working you need to put each template into its own (uniquely named) file. Each file should have a <code>.handlebars</code> extension.</p>

<h3>3. Convert your templates to handlebarsjs tempates</h3>

<p>If you weren&#8217;t already using handlebarsjs, you will need to convert your templates to use the handlebarjs format. This will require varying amounts of effort depending on the template library you were using previously. I was using <a href="http://underscorejs.org/#template">Underscore&#8217;s microtemplates</a>, but I kept the logic in my templates very thin. A global find and replace that swapped <code>&lt;%=</code> and <code>%&gt;</code> for <code>{ {</code> and <code>}}</code> took care of 90% of the conversion. A good overview of how handlebarsjs works is available on <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">their site</a>.</p>

<h3>4. Compile your templates</h3>

<p>You can compile all of your <code>.handlebars</code> templates into a single <code>.js</code> file in one shot like this:</p>

<p><code>$ handlebars path/to/templates/*.handlebars -f path/to/scripts/templates.js</code></p>

<p>A more in depth description of precompilation is available <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/precompilation.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>5. Include some scripts</h3>

<p>Before you can start using your templates, you need to include them in your code. Add a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag to your html that includes the <code>templates.js</code> file we just generated. You also need to include the handlebars runtime, which you can download from <a href="https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/archives/master">github</a>.</p>

<h3>6. Use &#8216;em</h3>

<p>Handlebars makes all of your templates accesable via the global <code>Handlbars.templates</code> object. Each template is named according to its file name, so if your input file is <code>person.handlebars,</code> it will be available as <code>Handlebars.templates.person</code>.</p>

<h3>Bonus</h3>

<p>If you like to over-optimize your development environment like I do, you can use this <a href="https://github.com/aiwilliams/guard-handlebars">Guard configuration</a> to watch your <code>.handlebars</code> files and re-compile them automatically whenever you make changes.</p>

<h2>Added Perks</h2>

<p>My main motivation for doing this was to move my extension off the deprecated Manifest version 1 configuration, but there are other benefits as well. Having each template in its own file is much tidier, and thus, more maintainable. And, because your clients no longer have to perform the compilation step when loading the page, you get a performance bonus too!</p>
